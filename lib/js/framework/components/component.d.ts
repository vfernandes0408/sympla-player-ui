     * The list of events that this component offers. These events should always be private and only directly
     * accessed from within the implementing component.
     *
     * Because TypeScript does not support private properties with the same name on different class hierarchy levels
     * (i.e. superclass and subclass cannot contain a private property with the same name), the default naming
     * convention for the event list of a component that should be followed by subclasses is the concatenation of the
     * camel-cased class name + 'Events' (e.g. SubClass extends Component => subClassEvents).
     * See {@link #componentEvents} for an example.
     *
     * Event properties should be named in camel case with an 'on' prefix and in the present tense. Async events may
     * have a start event (when the operation starts) in the present tense, and must have an end event (when the
     * operation ends) in the past tense (or present tense in special cases (e.g. onStart/onStarted or onPlay/onPlaying).
     * See {@link #componentEvents#onShow} for an example.
     *
     * Each event should be accompanied with a protected method named by the convention eventName + 'Event'
     * (e.g. onStartEvent), that actually triggers the event by calling {@link EventDispatcher#dispatch dispatch} and
     * passing a reference to the component as first parameter. Components should always trigger their events with these
     * methods. Implementing this pattern gives subclasses means to directly listen to the events by overriding the
     * method (and saving the overhead of passing a handler to the event dispatcher) and more importantly to trigger
     * these events without having access to the private event list.
     * See {@link #onShow} for an example.
     *
     * To provide external code the possibility to listen to this component's events (subscribe, unsubscribe, etc.),
     * each event should also be accompanied by a public getter function with the same name as the event's property,
     * that returns the {@link Event} obtained from the event dispatcher by calling {@link EventDispatcher#getEvent}.
     * See {@link #onShow} for an example.
     *
     * Full example for an event representing an example action in a example component:
     *
     * <code>
     * // Define an example component class with an example event
     * class ExampleComponent extends Component<ComponentConfig> {
       *
       *     private exampleComponentEvents = {
       *         onExampleAction: new EventDispatcher<ExampleComponent, NoArgs>()
       *     }
       *
       *     // constructor and other stuff...
       *
       *     protected onExampleActionEvent() {
       *        this.exampleComponentEvents.onExampleAction.dispatch(this);
       *    }
       *
       *    get onExampleAction(): Event<ExampleComponent, NoArgs> {
       *        return this.exampleComponentEvents.onExampleAction.getEvent();
       *    }
       * }
     *
     * // Create an instance of the component somewhere
     * var exampleComponentInstance = new ExampleComponent();
     *
     * // Subscribe to the example event on the component
     * exampleComponentInstance.onExampleAction.subscribe(function (sender: ExampleComponent) {
       *     console.log('onExampleAction of ' + sender + ' has fired!');
       * });
